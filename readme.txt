# This directory is part of the Bachelor Thesis "Geometric Autoencoders - Regularization and Visualization of a pullback metric tensor field".

Possibly some of the introduced methods will be merged to a python package in the near future, which would be installable via `pip` and `conda`.

## Contraction of the MNIST embedding

Dynamics of an MNIST embedding, captured every $n$ batch iterations.

If no data is unlabeled, give dummy labels from dataloader

## Fitting of Circles dataset

Fitting of Autoencoder to Spheres dataset
